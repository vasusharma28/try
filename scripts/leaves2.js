\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ooze of my skin, <br>I fall on the weeds and stones,<br>The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,<br>Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whip-stocks. <br><br>Agonies are one of my changes of garments,<br>I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I

hunters,<br>Not a single one over thirty years of age.<br><br>The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and massacred, it was

\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and never was, and never will be; <br>Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.<br><br>We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,<br>My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.<br><br>We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,<br>On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0killing all around and blowing up overhead. <br><br>Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,<br>Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our

the voice of my little captain,<br> We have not struck,  he composedly cries,  we have just begun our  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 part of the fighting. <br>Only three guns

they breathe, the little children in their cradles.<br><br>The wretched features of ennuy\u00e9s, the white features of corpses, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists, <br>The gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their strong-door'd \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging from \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0gates, and the dying emerging from gates, <br>The night pervades them and infolds them.<br><br>The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the husband, <br>The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,<br>The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,<br>And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt.<br>The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,<br>The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son sleeps,<br>The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?<br>And the murder'd person, how does he sleep?<br><br>The female that loves unrequited sleeps,<br>And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,<br>The head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,<br>And the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep.<br><br>I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the most restless, <br>I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them,<br>The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.<br><br>Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear,<br>The earth recedes from me into the night,<br>I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0beautiful. <br><br>I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other sleepers \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0each in turn, <br>I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,<br>And I become the other dreamers.<br><br>I am a dance\u2014play up there! the fit is whirling me fast!<br><br>I am the ever-laughing\u2014it is new moon and twilight,<br>I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever way \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I look, <br>Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is neither ground nor sea. <br><br>Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,<br>Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,<br>I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,<br>And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,<br>To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch'd arms, and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0resume the way; <br>Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0music and wild-flapping pennants of joy! <br><br>I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,<br>The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,<br>He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after to-day,<br>The stammerer, the well-form'd person, the wasted or feeble \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0person. <br>I am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,<br>My truant lover has come, and it is dark.<br><br>Double yourself and receive me darkness,<br>Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0him. <br><br>I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the dusk.<br><br>He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,<br>He rises with me silently from the bed.<br><br>Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0panting, <br>I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.<br><br>My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,<br>I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.<br><br>Be careful darkness! already what was it touch'd me?<br>I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,<br>I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away.<br><br>I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,<br>Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.<br><br>It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's,<br>I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson's \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0stockings. <br><br>It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter mid-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0night, <br>I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.<br><br>A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0coffin, <br>It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is blank \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0here, for reasons. <br><br>(It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0happy, <br>Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0has enough.) <br>I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0eddies of the sea, <br>His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs, <br>I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,<br>I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-\nfore-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0most on the rocks. <br><br>What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?<br>Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of his middle age? <br><br>Steady and long he struggles,<br>He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength holds \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0out, <br>The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0away, they roll him, swing him, turn him, <br>His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0bruis'd on rocks, <br>Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.<br><br>I turn but do not extricate myself,<br>Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.<br><br>The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,<br>The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts.<br><br>I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and fainter. <br><br>I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,<br>I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0upon me. <br><br>I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash'd to us \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0alive, <br>In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a barn. <br><br>Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,<br>Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench'd \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hills amid a crowd of officers, <br>His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,<br>He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch'd from \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0his cheeks, <br>He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0their parents. <br><br>The same at last and at last when peace is declared,<br>He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov'd soldiers \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all pass through, <br>The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,<br>The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the cheek, <br>He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hands and bids good-by to the army. <br><br>Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0together, <br>Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on the old homestead. <br><br>A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,<br>On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0chairs, <br>Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd her \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0face, <br>Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as she spoke. <br><br>My mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,<br>She look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pliant limbs, <br>The more she look'd upon her she loved her,<br>Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,<br>She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cook'd food for her, <br>She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fondness. <br><br>The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the afternoon she went away, <br>O my mother was loth to have her go away,<br>All the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0month, <br>She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,<br>But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.<br>A show of the summer softness\u2014a contact of something unseen \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014an amour of the light and air, <br>I am jealous and overwhelm'd with friendliness,<br>And will go gallivant with the light and air myself.<br><br>O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me,<br>Autumn and winter are in the dreams, the farmer goes with his
